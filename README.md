#  📝 To-Do List – Finish Tasks Before Closing Your Laptop 

This is a **simple To-Do List app** built using **Python’s Tkinter library**. It helps you keep track of tasks and also includes a **Namaz (prayer) checklist** to remind you of daily prayers.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Add new tasks**  
- ❌ **Delete selected tasks**  
- ✅ **Mark tasks as completed**  
- 🗑️ **Delete all completed tasks**  
- 🕌 **Namaz checklist:** Track Fajar, Zohar, Asar, Maghrib, and Isha prayers  
- ❌ **No task saving:** You need to finish your tasks before closing the app because it won't save them for next time.

I created this project to:

- Practice working with **Tkinter**  
- Build something useful for my daily routine  
- Learn about GUI layout, fonts, and event handling in Python

## 💻 How to Run It

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Save the script as `todo_namaz_app.py`.  
3. In your terminal or command prompt, run:

   ```bash
   python todo_namaz_app.py
   ```

No extra libraries are needed—it runs on Python’s built-in `tkinter`.
